# Blockchain Node Monitoring Tool

## Overview

The Blockchain Node Monitoring Tool is an advanced utility designed to monitor and manage blockchain nodes deployed on the B² Network and Bitcoin network. It provides real-time insights, alerts, and detailed analytics to ensure optimal performance and reliability of your nodes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 
  - Track node performance metrics including block height, synchronization status, and transaction throughput.
  - Monitor network health with real-time updates on node status and performance indicators.

- **Alerts & Notifications**:
  - Configure alerts for critical issues such as node downtime, synchronization failures, and low resource warnings.
  - Receive notifications via email or integrated messaging services.

- **Historical Data & Analytics**:
  - Access historical performance data to analyze trends and identify potential issues.
  - Generate reports on node activity, performance, and blockchain health.

- **Dashboard**:
  - User-friendly dashboard that provides a visual representation of node metrics and blockchain status.
  - Customizable views to focus on specific metrics or nodes.

- **API Access**:
  - RESTful API for integrating with other systems or applications.
  - Access detailed node and blockchain data programmatically.

- **Security**:
  - Secure access to monitoring data with role-based permissions and authentication mechanisms.
  - Encrypted communication between the tool and monitored nodes.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Node**: A B² Network node or Bitcoin node.
- **Server**: A server or cloud instance with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) to run the monitoring tool.
- **Environment**: Node.js (version 14.x or later) and npm.

### B² Network Configuration

To connect to the B² Mainnet, configure the following network details:

- **RPC URL**: 
  - `https://mainnet.b2-rpc.com` 
  - `https://rpc.bsquared.network`
- **ChainID**: `223`
- **Block Explorer URLs**: 
  - [B² Explorer](https://explorer.bsquared.network) 
  - [Mainnet Blockscout](https://mainnet-blockscout.bsquared.network)
- **Currency**: BTC

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blockchain-node-monitoring-tool.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd blockchain-node-monitoring-tool
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure the Tool**

   Edit the `config.json` file to include your B² Network or Bitcoin node details. Example configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "node": {
       "rpcUrl": "https://mainnet.b2-rpc.com",
       "chainId": 223,
       "blockExplorerUrl": "https://explorer.bsquared.network",
       "currency": "BTC"
     },
     "alerts": {
       "email": "your-email@example.com",
       "thresholds": {
         "cpuUsage": 85,
         "memoryUsage": 90
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Start the Tool**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the Dashboard**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the dashboard.

## Usage

1. **Dashboard Overview**: The main dashboard displays key metrics including node synchronization status, block height, and transaction throughput.
2. **Alerts Management**: Configure and manage alerts through the settings menu.
3. **Data Export**: Export performance data and reports in CSV or JSON format for further analysis.
4. **API Integration**: Utilize the REST API for integrating monitoring data with other systems or applications. API documentation is available in the `docs/api.md` file.
